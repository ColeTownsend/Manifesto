Manifesto
=========

I beleive in the constant expansion of one's knowledge.

I beleive in the power of meditation and contemplation.

I beleive in that there's more to life that what meets the eye.

I beleive in the power held in the bonds of friendships and family.

I beleive in only doing what you love.

I beleive in free will.

I beleive a universal definition of good.

I beleive in simplicity.

I beleive in making stupid things for fun.

I don't beleive in oblivion after death.

I don't beleive in the destruction of information.

I don't beleive we are passive witness of time.
